Description:
  My web app is designed to show the community outreach of indie games. One of the largest 
 hurdles an indie developer must overcome when releasing a game is marketing. Due to the
 lack of budget that large studios have, many indie devs turn to social media as their main
 marketing campaign platform. My application is designed to compare 2 users from similar
 posting times to compare community outreach.
